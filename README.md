# bash-console-runner
A dirty couple of bash scripts that spawn a terminal emulator with whatever executable you feed to it.  
At the end of the execution it will print the return value and the duration of its execution.

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fabrizio-Volonte/bash-console-runner.git
cd bash-console-runner
sudo ./install
```

## Run
When you want to run any executable just do:  
`bash-console-runner-start <executable>`
### Example
folder structure:  
ðŸ“‚  
â”œâ”€ hello_world  
â””â”€ hello_world.c  
run:  
`bash-console-runner-start hello_world`

## Setting Your Terminal Emulator
You will find the xterm terminal hardcoded as a fallback in the bash-console-runner-start script.  
Different terminals handle this in pretty different ways Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯  

To use your terminal emulator of choice, edit the configuartion file in ~/.config/bash-console-runner/terminal-emulator.conf.  
Either uncomment the terminal command you want to use (if you uncomment multiple the first uncommented will be used) or add your own.  

If you know a terminal that has not been added to the list and you wish to see it added to the configuration then request it in an [issue](https://github.com/Fabrizio-Volonte/bash-console-runner/issues) and kindly provide the command in question.
